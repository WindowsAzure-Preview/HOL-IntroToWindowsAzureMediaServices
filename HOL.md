## Exercise 1: Uploading a Job from the Portal for HTML5 playback ##

The Windows Azure Management Portal provides a way to quickly create a Windows Azure Media Services account. You can use your account to access Media Services that enable you to store, encrypt, encode, manage, and stream media content in Windows Azure. At the time you create a Media Services account, you also create an associated storage account (or use an existing one) in the same geographic region as the Media Services account.

<a name="creating-a-media-service-account" />
### Task 1 - Creating a Media Services Account ###

This task explains how to use the Quick Create method to create a new Media Services account and then associate it with a storage account.

1. Log into the [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).

1. Click **New** | **App Services** | **Media Service**, and then click **Quick Create**.

	![Creating a new Media Service](Images/creating-a-media-service.png?raw=true "Creating a new Media Service")

	_Creating a new Media Service_

1. In **NAME**, enter the name of the new account. A Media Services account name is all lower-case numbers or letters with no spaces, and is 3 - 24 characters in length.

1. In **REGION**, select the geographic region that will be used to store the metadata records for your Media Services account. Only the available Media Services regions appear in the dropdown.
 
1. In **STORAGE ACCOUNT**, select a storage account to provide blob storage of the media content from your Media Services account. You can select an existing storage account in the same geographic region as your Media Services account, or you can create a new storage account. A new storage account is created in the same region.
 
1. If you created a new storage account, in **NEW STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME**, enter a name for the storage account. The rules for storage account names are the same as for Media Services accounts.

1. Click **Create Media Service** at the bottom of the form.

	You can monitor the status of the process in the message area at the bottom of the window.
The **media services** page opens with the new account displayed. When the status changes to Active, it means the account is successfully created.

<a name="uploading-content-to-media-services" />
### Task 2 - Uploading content to Media Services ###

In this task you will upload content to the already created media service using the Windows Azure Management Portal.

1. In the [Management Portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=256666&clcid=0x409), click **Media Services** and then click the name of the media service created in the previous task.

1. Click the **Content** view at the top of the page and then click **Upload** at the bottom toolbar. Your view should look similar to the following screenshot.

	![Uploading Content](Images/uploading-content.png?raw=true "Uploading Content")

	_Uploading Content_

1. In the **Upload Content** dialog, click **Browse Your Computer** and browse to the desired asset file. Click the file and then click **Open** or press **Enter**.

	>**Note:** You can use the following short video to try uploading content to Media Services: [Azure_Intro.mp4](http://dpeshare.blob.core.windows.net/mediaserviceslabassets/Azure_Intro.mp4)
 
1. In the **Upload Content** dialog, click the check button to submit the file and content name.

	![Upload Content dialog](Images/upload-content-dialog.png?raw=true "Upload Content dialog")

	_Upload Content dialog_

1. The upload will start and you can track progress at the bottom toolbar of the portal. 
 
	![Uploading progress](Images/uploading-progress.png?raw=true "Uploading progress")

	_Uploading progress_

	Once the upload is complete, you will see the new asset listed in the _Content_ list. By convention, the name will have **-Source** appended at the end to help track new content as source content for encoding tasks.

	If the file size value does not get updated after the uploading process finishes, press the **Sync Metadata** button. This synchronizes the asset file size with the actual file size in storage and refreshes the value on the _Content_ page. 

<a name="uploading-content-to-media-services" />
### Task 3 - Encoding content in Media Services ###

In this task you will encode an already uploaded video in the Windows Azure Management Portal.

1. Click on the desired source video, in this case the one that you have just uploaded, and then click **Encode** at the bottom toolbar.

	![Encode Button](Images/encode-button.png?raw=true "Encode Button")

	_Encode Button_

1. In the **Windows Azure Media Encoder** dialog, choose from one of the common or advanced encoding presets. For this task purposes, choose **Playback via HTML5 (IE/Chrome/Safari)**. More information about the presets:

	**Common Presets**

	**Playback on PC/Mac (via Flash/Silverlight)**. This preset produces a Smooth Streaming asset with the following characteristics: 44.1 kHz 16 bits/sample stereo audio CBR encoded at 96 kbps using AAC, and 720p video CBR encoded at 6 bitrates ranging from 3400 kbps to 400 kbps using H.264 Main Profile, and two second GOPs. 
 	
 	**Playback via HTML5 (IE/Chrome/Safari)**. This preset produces a single MP4 file with the following characteristics: 44.1 kHz 16 bits/sample stereo audio CBR encoded at 128 kbps using AAC, and 720p video CBR encoded at 4500 kbps using H.264 Main Profile. 
	
	**Playback on iOS devices and PC/Mac**. This preset produces an asset with the same characteristics as the Smooth Streaming asset (described above), but in a format that can be used to deliver Apple HLS streams to iOS devices. 

	**Advanced Presets** 
	
	The [Task Preset Strings for Windows Azure Media Encoder](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=270865&clcid=0x409) topic explains what each preset in the Advanced Presets list means. 

	![Encoding Media](Images/encoding-media.png?raw=true "Encoding Media")

	_Encoding Media_

	Currently, the portal does not support all the encoding formats that are supported by the Media Encoder. It also does not support media asset encryption/decryption. You can perform these tasks programmatically, for more information see [Building Applications with the Media Services SDK for .NET] (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=270866&clcid=0x409) and [Task Preset Strings for Windows Azure Media Encoder]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=270865&clcid=0x409).

1. In the **Windows Azure Media Encoder** dialog, enter the desired friendly output content name or accept the default. Then click the check button to start the encoding operation and you can track progress from the bottom of the portal.

<a name="uploading-content-to-media-services" />
### Task 4 - Publishing and Playing content in Media Services ###

In this task, you will publish the already encoded video and play it directly in the Windows Azure Management Portal.

1. Click an asset which is not published, in this case, the video that was just encoded. Then click the **Publish** button at the bottom toolbar to publish the encoded video to a public URL. Once the content is published to a URL, the URL can be opened by a client player capable of rendering the encoded content.

	![Publishing media in Windows Azure](Images/publish-button.png?raw=true "Publishing media in Windows Azure")

	_Publishing media in Windows Azure_

1. Once the publishing process finishes, select the video and click the **Play** button at the bottom toolbar. Only content that has been published is playable from the portal. Also, the encoding must be supported by your browser.

## Exercise 2: Building A Console app using the Media Services SDK that uploads, encodes, and streams a video programmatically ##

In this exercise, you will create a new console application that allows you to perform the different tasks (uploading, encoding, and publishing) on your Azure Media Services subscription. This application uses the Media Services SDK to accomplish these operations.

<a name="programmatically-uploading-a-mp4-video" />
### Task 1 - Programmatically Uploading a Mp4 video ###

1. Open **Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Express for Desktop** (or higher) in elevated administrator mode. If the **User Account Control** dialog appears, click **Yes**.

1. In the **File** menu, choose **New project** and select the **Templates | C#** node from the left pane, and then select the **Console Application** template.

1. Enter _MyMediaServicesManager_ as the project **Name**, choose a desired **Location**, and click **Ok**.

1. Open the **Package Manager Console** by clicking **View | Other Windows | Package Manager Console**.

1. In the console, type _Install-Package windowsazure.mediaservices_ to download and install the **Windows Azure Media Services** NuGet package and its dependencies.

1. In the _Program.cs_ file add the following using statements.

	````C#
	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MediaServices.Client;
	using System.IO;
	````

1. Paste the following code in the _Program.cs_ file, inside the **Main** method. This code prompts the user about the different steps that the final app will perform, and will aid you in completing the exercise.

	(Code Snippet - _Intro to Media Services - Ex2 - Console Logs_)

	````C#
	Console.WriteLine("Uploading Video");
            
	Console.WriteLine("Uploading Completed");
	Console.WriteLine("Encoding Video");

	Console.WriteLine("Encoding Completed");
	Console.WriteLine("Publishing Video");

	Console.WriteLine("Publishing Completed");
	Console.ReadLine();
	````

1. Go to the **Windows Azure Management Portal**, click **Media Services** in the left menu, and then click your **Media Services** name. The quickstart page will be displayed.

1. Make sure that **C#** is selected in the **Choose a language** section. Under the **WRITE SOME CODE** section, click **UPLOAD A VIDEO PROGRAMMATICALLY**.

	![Programmatically uploading a video](Images/programatically-uploading-a-video.png?raw=true "Programmatically uploading a video")

	_Programmatically uploading a video_

1. Copy the code snippet shown in the portal and paste it in inside the **Main** method, between the lines that notify about the uploading process. The resulting code will be similar to the following one.

	(Code Snippet - _Intro to Media Services - Ex2 - Upload Video_)

	<!-- mark:5-9 -->
	````C#
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
		Console.WriteLine("Uploading Video");

		var uploadFilePath = @"[YOUR FILE PATH]";
		var context = new CloudMediaContext("[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME]", "[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY]");
		var uploadAsset = context.Assets.Create(Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(uploadFilePath), AssetCreationOptions.None);
		var assetFile = uploadAsset.AssetFiles.Create(Path.GetFileName(uploadFilePath));
		assetFile.Upload(uploadFilePath);

		Console.WriteLine("Uploading Completed");
		Console.WriteLine("Encoding Video");

		Console.WriteLine("Encoding Completed");
		Console.WriteLine("Publishing Video");

		Console.WriteLine("Publishing Completed");
		Console.ReadLine();
		}
	}
	````
	The preceding code uses the **CloudMediaContext** class to create an _asset file_ using the provided file path. Once the asset file is created, the **Upload** method is called to start the uploading operation.

1. Update the code you just pasted to point to the video that you want to upload, by replacing the _YOUR FILE PATH_ string. It could be the same video used in the previous exercise. If you are going to do that it is recommended that you rename the video to differentiate it from the one uploaded in the first exercise of this lab.

1. Go to your Media Service dashboard in the Management Portal and click **Manage Keys** button from the bottom toolbar.

	![Manage Media Service Keys](Images/manage-media-service-keys.png?raw=true)

	_Managing Media Service Keys_

1.	In the dialog box, copy the **Primary Media Service Access Key**.

	![Copying Primary Media Service Key](Images/copying-primary-media-service-key.png?raw=true)

	_Copying Media Service Primary Key_

1.	Replace the key you copied in previous step in the second parameter when instantiating a **CloudMediaContext** class.

	````C#
	var context = new CloudMediaContext("[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME]", "[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY]"); 
	````

<a name="programmatically-encoding-a-mp4-video" />
### Task 2 - Programmatically Encoding a Mp4 video using Smooth Streaming ###

1. Add the following using statement at the top of the _Program.cs_ file.

	````C#
	using System.Threading;
	````

1. Add the following code between the WriteLine blocks that notify about the initiation and termination of the encoding operation.

	(Code Snippet - _Intro to Media Services - Ex2 - Encode Video in Smooth Streaming_)

	<!-- mark:3-26 -->
	````C#
    Console.WriteLine("Encoding Video");

    var encodeAssetId = uploadAsset.Id; // "YOUR ASSET ID";
    var encodingPreset = "H264 Smooth Streaming 720p";
    var assetToEncode = context.Assets.Where(a => a.Id == encodeAssetId).FirstOrDefault();
    if (assetToEncode == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("Could not find assetId: " + encodeAssetId);
    }

    IJob job = context.Jobs.Create("Encoding " + assetToEncode.Name + " to " + encodingPreset);

    IMediaProcessor latestWameMediaProcessor = (from p in context.MediaProcessors
                                                where p.Name == "Windows Azure Media Encoder"
                                                select p).ToList()
                                                .OrderBy(wame => new Version(wame.Version)).LastOrDefault();
    ITask encodeTask = job.Tasks.AddNew("Encoding", latestWameMediaProcessor, encodingPreset, TaskOptions.None);
    encodeTask.InputAssets.Add(assetToEncode);
    encodeTask.OutputAssets.AddNew(assetToEncode.Name + " as " + encodingPreset, AssetCreationOptions.None);

    job.StateChanged += new EventHandler<JobStateChangedEventArgs>((sender, jsc) =>
        Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0}\n State: {1}\n Time: {2}\n\n", ((IJob)sender).Name, jsc.CurrentState, DateTime.UtcNow.ToString(@"yyyy_M_d_hhmmss"))));
    job.Submit();
    job.GetExecutionProgressTask(CancellationToken.None).Wait();

    var preparedAsset = job.OutputMediaAssets.FirstOrDefault();


    Console.WriteLine("Encoding Completed"); 
	````

	The preceding code uses the **CloudMediaContext** instance to create an encoding job with an encoding task to the specified preset. In this case a smooth streaming encoding (H264 Smooth Streaming 720p) is used.
	Then the job is submitted. Notice that an event handler is attached to the **StateChanged** event of the job, what means that every time the state of the job changes that will be prompted to the console.

### Task 3 - Programmatically Delivering and Streaming a Mp4 video ###

1. Add the following code between the WriteLine blocks that notify about the initiation and termination of the publishing operation.

	(Code Snippet - _Intro to Media Services - Ex2 - Streaming MP4 Video_)

	<!-- mark:3-32 -->
	````C#
    Console.WriteLine("Publishing Video");

    var streamingAssetId = preparedAsset.Id; // "YOUR ASSET ID";
    var daysForWhichStreamingUrlIsActive = 365;
    var streamingAsset = context.Assets.Where(a => a.Id == streamingAssetId).FirstOrDefault();
    var accessPolicy = context.AccessPolicies.Create(streamingAsset.Name, TimeSpan.FromDays(daysForWhichStreamingUrlIsActive),
                                                AccessPermissions.Read | AccessPermissions.List);
    string streamingUrl = string.Empty;
    var assetFiles = streamingAsset.AssetFiles.ToList();
    var streamingAssetFile = assetFiles.Where(f => f.Name.ToLower().EndsWith("m3u8-aapl.ism")).FirstOrDefault();
    if (streamingAssetFile != null)
    {
        var locator = context.Locators.CreateLocator(LocatorType.OnDemandOrigin, streamingAsset, accessPolicy);
        Uri hlsUri = new Uri(locator.Path + streamingAssetFile.Name + "/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)");
        streamingUrl = hlsUri.ToString();
    }
    streamingAssetFile = assetFiles.Where(f => f.Name.ToLower().EndsWith(".ism")).FirstOrDefault();
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(streamingUrl) && streamingAssetFile != null)
    {
        var locator = context.Locators.CreateLocator(LocatorType.OnDemandOrigin, streamingAsset, accessPolicy);
        Uri smoothUri = new Uri(locator.Path + streamingAssetFile.Name + "/manifest");
        streamingUrl = smoothUri.ToString();

        var mp4Uri = new UriBuilder(locator.Path);
        mp4Uri.Path += "/" + streamingAssetFile.Name;
        streamingUrl = mp4Uri.ToString();
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Streaming Url: " + streamingUrl);

    Console.WriteLine("Publishing Completed");
    Console.ReadLine();
	````

	The preceding code locates the asset and creates a locator URI that will be used to access the asset publicly.

1. Press **F5** to run the console application, and wait until the uploading, encoding and publishing finishes.

1. In the **MainPage.xaml** file of the C# version, modify the MediaPlayer control Xaml to add the Adaptive plugin to the plugins collection on the player framework, as shown in the following code.

	<!--mark:7-11-->
	````XAML
	<PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer HorizontalAlignment="Left"
                                Height="600"
                                Margin="200,96,0,0"
                                VerticalAlignment="Top"
                                Width="1000"
								Source ="[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-VIDEO-URL]"
	>
		<PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer.Plugins>
			<adaptive:AdaptivePlugin />
		</PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer.Plugins>
	</PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer>
	````

1. Before compiling the app, target your app to x86, x64, or ARM. Because the IIS Smooth Streaming Client is written in unmanaged code, **AnyCPU** will not work and instead you must target and build your app for each platform you wish to support. To do this, go to the **Debug** combobox in the toolbar, expand its options and click **Configuration Manager**. In the row of your current project, expand the options of the **Platform** combobox and select **x64**. Alternatively, you can choose **x86** or **ARM** if your processor supports them.

## Exercise 4: Monetization ##

In this exercise you will add advertisements support to  monetize your application, by using a VMAP file that defines the ads that will be played and at which moment.

Scheduling is the first step to play ads in the player framework. This allows your app to tell the player framework when to play each ad. Ad scheduling is separate from the ad handling (playing the ad) and is independent of the type of ad you want to play.

One of the scheduling options is the **VMAP** (Digital Video Multiple Ad Playlist). VMAP is an xml schema that defines when ads should play for a given piece of content. The player framework includes a VMAP scheduler plugin that will download, parse and consume to control the timing of ads for you.

<a name="adding-advertisements-using-a-vmap-file-to-a-windows8-video-app" />
### Task 1 - Adding advertisements using a VMAP file to a Windows 8 video app ###

In this task, you will add advertising support to the media player control of the app using the vmap scheduler plugin.

1. If not already open, start **Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows 8** and select **Open Project...** from the Start Page. In the **Open Project** dialog, browse to **Ex4-Advertising\Begin** in the **Source** folder of the lab, select **Begin.sln** in the folder for the language of your preference (C# or JavaScript) and click **Open**. Alternatively, you may continue with the solution that you obtained after completing the previous exercise.

1. Add a reference to the _Microsoft Player Framework Advertising Plugin_. To do this, right-click the **References** folder and select **Add Reference**. Under **Windows | Extensions**, check **Microsoft Player Framework Advertising Plugin** and click **OK**.

	![Adding reference to the Advertising Plugin C#](Images/adding-reference-to-advertising-plugin-cs.png?raw=true "Adding reference to the Advertising Plugin C#")

    _Adding reference to the Advertising Plugin C#_

	![Adding reference to the Advertising Plugin JavaScript](Images/adding-reference-to-advertising-plugin-js.png?raw=true "Adding reference to the Advertising Plugin JavaScript")

    _Adding reference to the Advertising Plugin JavaScript_

1. Add the following namespace reference for the _Microsoft Player Framework Advertising Plugin_ at the top of the **MainPage.xaml** file (for the C# project) or at the end of the head section in the **default.html** file (for the JavaScript project).

	C#

	````XAML
	xmlns:ads="using:Microsoft.PlayerFramework.Advertising"
	````

	JavaScript

	````HTML
	<!-- PlayerFramework Advertising references -->
	<link href="/Microsoft.PlayerFramework.Js.Advertising/css/PlayerFramework.Advertising.css" rel="stylesheet">
	<script src="/Microsoft.PlayerFramework.Js.Advertising/js/PlayerFramework.Advertising.js"></script>
	````

1. In the media player control, change the **Source** property (for the C# version) or the **src** property (for the JavaScript version) to point to the URL of the video encoded in smooth streaming at the end of exercise 2.

	C#

	<!-- mark:6 -->
	````XAML
    <PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer HorizontalAlignment="Left"
								Height="600"
								Margin="200,96,0,0"
								VerticalAlignment="Top"
								Width="1000"
								Source="[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-VIDEO-URL]">
        <PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer.Plugins>
            <adaptive:AdaptivePlugin />
        </PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer.Plugins>
    </PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer>
	````

	JavaScript

	<!-- mark:6 -->
	````HTML
	<div data-win-control="PlayerFramework.MediaPlayer" 
		data-win-options="{                                 
						  width: 1000,
						  height: 600,
						  autoplay: true,
						  src: '[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-VIDEO-URL]',
				  }">
	</div>
	````

1. Now you will add a new **VmapSchedulerPlugin** plugin to the media player that you added in the previous exercise pointing to a _vmap.xml_ file that you will add to the local assets folder of the project in the next task. To do this, update the media player control with the following code.

	C#

	<!-- mark:9-10 -->
	````XAML
	<PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer HorizontalAlignment="Left"
								Height="600"
								Margin="200,96,0,0"
								VerticalAlignment="Top"
								Width="1000"
								Source="[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-VIDEO-URL]">
		<PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer.Plugins>
			<adaptive:AdaptivePlugin />
			<ads:VmapSchedulerPlugin Source="ms-appx:///Assets/vmap.xml" />
			<ads:AdHandlerPlugin />
		</PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer.Plugins>
	</PlayerFramework:MediaPlayer>
	````

	JavaScript

	<!-- mark:7-9 -->
	````HTML
	<div data-win-control="PlayerFramework.MediaPlayer" 
         data-win-options="{                                 
                                width: 1000,
                                height: 600,
                                autoplay: true,
                                src: '[YOUR-MEDIA-SERVICE-VIDEO-URL]',
                                vmapSchedulerPlugin: {
                                    source: 'ms-appx:///Assets/vmap.xml'
                                }
                          }">
    </div>

### Task 2 - Exploring the VMAP file and running the app ###

In this task you will add an already pre-configured VMAP file to the local assets folder of the application and explore its main content. Finally, you will run the application to check that the advertisements are displayed at the beginning of the video.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Assets** folder of the SampleMediaPlayer project and select **Add | Existing Item**. Browse to the **Source/Assets** folder of this lab, select the _vmap.xml_ file and click **Add**.

	> **Note:** For the JavaScript version, you will have to manually create the Assets folder in the project. To do this, right-click the **SampleMediaPlayer** project, select **Add | New Folder** and name it _Assets_.

	![Importing the VMAP file](Images/importing-the-vmap-file.png?raw=true "Importing the VMAP file")

    _Importing the VMAP file_

	> **Note:** The vmap.xml file is inserted in the local assets folder of the solution just for example purposes. However, you should not distribute this file in your solutions as anybody could modify the advertisements that you wish to display. Ideally, this file should be placed in your Advertisement Server along with the advertising content.

1. Open the **vmap.xml** file and explore its content.

	The VMAP standard is used by content owners to describe ad breaks, such as the timing for each break, the number of ads available and which types should be supported. VMAP is very useful when content owners don't have control over the video player.

	**VMAP elements**

	**AdBreak:** it’s used to specify at which moment an ad should be played, meaning at the beginning of the video, at the end, at some played percentage or at which specific hours/minutes/seconds.

	**AdSource:** it’s used to specify which ads should be displayed in an ad break.

	**VASTData:** it specifies the video player what to play. All the ads that will be displayed should be inside this container.

	**TrackingEvents:** it’s used to track the start and end of an ad break and whether an error occurred during the ad break.

	> **Note:** The media files used in the provided VMAP file are videos already uploaded to a blob storage. Their URIs can be found inside the MediaFile elements of the vmap.xml file.

1. Press **F5** to start the app. Notice that the advertisement is played in the video player according to the information provided in the VMAP file. When it ends, you should see the main content video starting.
